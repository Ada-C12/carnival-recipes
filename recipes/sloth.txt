Chris' Steamed Buns
-------------------
Time: 4 hours

Directions:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/4 cup water
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 lbs beef round steak, chuck
3 1/4 cups flour
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1/4 teaspoon salt

2. Mix in 1/2 cup warm water, flour, salt, 2 tablespoons sugar, and vegetable oil.
3. Knead until dough surface is smooth and elastic. Roll over in a greased bowl, and let stand until triple in size, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
4. Punch down dough, and spread out on a floured board.
5. Sprinkle baking powder evenly on surface, and knead for 5 minutes.
8. Bring water to a boil in wok, and reduce heat to medium; the water should still be boiling.
9. SPATZLE: Sift flour, salt, and nutmeg.
10. Transfer as many buns on wax paper as will comfortably fit onto steam-plate leaving 1 to 2 inches between the buns. At least 2 inches space should be left between steam-plate and the wok.
12. Force through large-hole colander into a pot of rapidly boing salted water.
13. Continue steaming batches of buns until all are cooked.
